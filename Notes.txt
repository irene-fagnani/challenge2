- clear and complete documentation and comments in the code

- you should print warnings in functions that only work if the matrix is not compressed
- you could have implemented the operator* as a friend function, as suggested

- the resize_matrix method does not behave as expected.
    It replaces all the elements inside a matrix with the given value and does not modify the number of rows/columns.
- in the constructor you give the possibility to fill the whole matrix with a value T.
    Not very useful because we are dealing with sparse matrices.

- avoid commenting a huge part of the code used for testing.
    Put it in a separate source file in a test foalder, instead.
